# sys-gatsby-starter
A basic template for a Gatsby website using University of York styling.

Uses the CSS, fonts and some components from the University's digital pattern library (https://www.york.ac.uk/pattern-library/).

The University digital pattern library is public and therefore this Gatsby starter has been made public too.

## Usage
Run `gatsby new new-project-name <final-starter-name>` and you're off.
