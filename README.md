# sys-gatsby-starter
A basic template for a Gatsby website using University styling.

Uses the CSS, fonts and some components from the University's digital pattern library (https://github.com/university-of-york/design-patterns).

The University digital pattern library is public and therefore this Gatsby starter has been made public too.

## Usage
Run `gatsby new new-project-name <final-starter-name>` and you're off.
